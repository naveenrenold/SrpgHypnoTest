okay things to do:
1. Event -> battle seamless - done

opening events are before map starts - conversations
auto events can happen after map start - map events based on conditions like map start , turn etc
bookmarks for common data


2. what does EV enemy mean compared to regular enemies - event enemies

3. what do do
 -> add skills 
 -> balance to always 2 shot and not get 2 shot

 str- 7
 def - 3

 axe - 7
 sword - 6

 7+7 -3 = 11

 3. game balance try abit
 make item effects animation conme 
 item not working
 might be easier to make items as weapons tbh
 Need to check how to implement aura abilities

 converted item to weapons lets see if animation are different

 before that check states
 it work but make weapon durability low

4. fix game not end - done
 made effect targets
 make algo scale off mag

 5.it works but two animations overlap
 also double check if battle happens
 change from staff to item

 effective is too strong

 6. add kneelshot
